    Hashing is a fundamental concept of computer science.
    In Java, efficient hashing algorithms stand behind some of the most popular collections, such as the HashMap (check out this in-depth article) and the HashSet.
    In this tutorial, we'll focus on how hashCode() works, how it plays into collections and how to implement it correctly.
